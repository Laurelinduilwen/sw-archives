perhaps the archives are complete?

a small application built with react using the star wars api that this young padawan is doing for an assignment

just _"\$npm i"_ than _"\$npm run start"_ and enjoy!

this is where the fun begins~

**version 0.1:**
this is highly in progress, the final project will use 2 different APIs because I use to be a huge star wars fan and I want to do it properly.

Lots of open ends and senseless things are included in this version (like the searchbar which doesnt work yet and the movie component for detailed info when you click on it) but
the next version will fix most these things (hopefully...I have everything under control at the moment...)

For the final version I want the movie component to display both the actor information and the character information and I do plan to maintain this little project for a while

I am using both SWAPI and movidb api for this because moviedb api provides this brilliant pictures and additional information (such as cast,review scores and box office info) while the SWAPI is the required API
and covers most stuff about character, planets and starships

the SWAPI also does not include the last 3 movies which is not really a bummer considering they are terrible and snuffed out all passion and love I had for the series but again for the sake of completion...

**version 0.2:**

oh ho! that was a bit fast but the application is now complete with a proper redux store, it is hitting nearly all endpoints in SWAPI and storing everything like a greedy java.
also did the movie crawl, just click toggle to see it when you are on movie page :3

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

SWAPI does not include any information for episodes 7-8-9, the containers are just there for decoration atm but I will probably find a way to populate them with other information in the future. they will automatically start working if SWAPI ever decides to include those information but cant really blame them tbh. thank you disney for ruining my childhood (ironic...)
