# sw-archives

perhaps the archives are complete?

a small application built with react using the star wars api that this young padawan is doing for an assignment

just npm i than npm run start and enjoy!

this is where the fun begins~

version 0.1:
Hello there!
this is highly in progress, the final project will use 2 different APIs because I use to be a huge star wars fan and I want to do it properly.

Lots of open ends and senseless things are included in this version (like the searchbar which doesnt work yet and the movie component for detailed info when you click on it) but
the next version will fix most these things (hopefully...I have everything under control at the moment...)

For the final version I want the movie component to display both the actor information and the character information and I do plan to maintain this little project for a while

I am using both SWAPI and movidb api for this because moviedb api provides this brilliant pictures and additional information (such as cast,review scores and box office info) while the SWAPI is the required API
and covers most stuff about character, planets and starships

the SWAPI also does not include the last 3 movies which is not really a bummer considering they are terrible and snuffed out all passion and love I had for the series but again for the sake of completion...
